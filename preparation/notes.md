# The Admin Dashboard Project Notes

## 20230207
- starting this project today. Since the design file provided seems to have some clear sections layed out already, I will not spend time planning the whole thing beforehand. Instead I will start implementing the main grid sections and define separate sub-sections as I go and see fit
- Most of the project has to lean on grid. I did make some choices already for flex, mainly because simply adding flex will line up the items in a column which is a quick solution working great here in my opinion.
